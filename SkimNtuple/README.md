# An Introduction to the `SkimNtuple` Toolkit

`ntuple_reducer.cc` is used to skim `TTree`s. This macro used `TTreeReader` to transform the `std::vector` stored in `TBrach`s to `float`. In other words, transform the `TTree` to a flat `TTree`. Then `RDataFrame` helps us select events in the flat `TTree`.

`ntuple_reader.py` helps us transform `TBranch`s in the `TTree` to `TH1`s. But we plan to combine the `ntuple_reader.py` with plot macros. 

`SE2T3` is a useful tool that copy `.root` files from T2 to my T3. We can run `python3 T22T3.py --mode 1,2,3,4` to use different functions. The script can check the result of a CRAB job (has output files or not), copy files from T2 to T3, generate `HTCondor` bash scripts and `hadd` `.root` files. The scripts in the `Tools` subfolder can be excuted indenpendently.

`GenerateReduceScript.py` can generate `HTCondor` bash scripts to execute `ntuple_reducer.cc`.
