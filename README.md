This repository is about my ZH(bb) analysis macros.

`ZpeakSig` is about the analysis of Z to mu+ mu-. This analysis is the signal process. `ZpeakBkg` is about the analysis of the background processes. Background proccesses include
diboson background, Z+jets background, ttbar background, single t background, and QCD background.

`zpeakCutflow` is the analysis about the cut-flow of signal process and background process.
